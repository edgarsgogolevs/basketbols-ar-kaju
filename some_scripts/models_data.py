The Oracle of Delphi was the most important shrine in all Greece, and in theory all Greeks respected its independence. The oracle is one of the best-known religious institutions of the ancient Greek world. The earliest traditions regarding the oracle of Delphi describe an Earth goddess named Themis, revered as \"the giver of divine law and custom.\" Her successor was Phoebe, another Titaness. The Pythia, was the title of the priestess at the Temple of Apollo at Delphi who served as the oracle, commonly known as the Oracle of Delphi. The name Pythia is derived from Pytho, which in myth was the original name of Delphi. In etymology, the Greeks derived this place name from the verb, pythein (πύθειν, \"to rot\"), which refers to the sickly sweet smell of the decomposition of the body of the monstrous Python after he was slain by Apollo.",
